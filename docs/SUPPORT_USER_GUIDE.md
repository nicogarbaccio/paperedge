## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is there a phone number to call for support?**
A: Currently, our main support channel is through bug reports and feature requests on this page. We review all submissions regularly.

**Q: How long does it take to get a response to a bug report?**
A: We aim to acknowledge critical bugs within 24 hours and other issues within 48 hours. You won't receive an email reply, but you can check the status of your reports in your account.

**Q: Can I delete my bug report after submitting?**
A: Contact our support team for assistance with modifying or deleting reports.

### Help Center

A: Try different search terms, or submit a feature request for documentation on that topic. If it's a bug, submit a bug report instead.

**Q: Are there video tutorials?**
A: We don't currently have videos, but our Help Center articles are comprehensive. If you'd like video tutorials, submit a feature request!

### Feature Requests

**Q: Will my feature request definitely be built?**
A: Popular features are prioritized, but we can't guarantee every feature will be implemented. We focus on features that benefit the most users.

**Q: How often do you review feature requests?**
A: We review them daily. Features with the most votes are discussed first.

**Q: Can I vote multiple times on the same feature?**
A: No, you get one vote per feature. You can remove your vote and vote on a different feature if you change your mind.

### Bug Reports

**Q: Will my personal data be exposed?**
A: No. We only collect anonymized browser information (browser type, OS, etc.). We never collect personal data or account information.

**Q: What happens after I report a bug?**
A: Our team reviews bug reports and prioritizes them by severity. Critical bugs are fixed first. You can check the Help Center for workarounds in the meantime.

**Q: Should I report the same bug multiple times to get attention?**
A: No, please report it once with as much detail as possible. Multiple reports make it harder for us to track the issue.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Q: Why don't keyboard shortcuts work on my device?**
